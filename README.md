# HERORIC - H.E.R.O. game port project for Oric Atmos

This is a small demo of a very early work in progress, based on my early  (and very naive) experimentations with the OSDK in 2015 at animating simple sprites in C on Oric Atmos.

The project is to develop a clone of the original Atari VCS 2600 H.E.R.O. game for the Oric, since this game has been ported to virtually all mainstream micros of the era (C64, Amstrad CPC, even the ZX Spectrum!!) at some time.

Presently, this program only displays an animated sprite with colour attributes. The sprite can   be moved around the screen using arrows, and program execution can be stopped by pressing the SPACE key.

Actually using colour attributes for a real implementation of the game would entail many problems, so an alternative would be to use AIC mode (Alternate Inverting Colors) as in recent Oric productions.

Note that this draft project has been at a standstill since its inception in 2015. I may be going forward with development at a later point in time, but I currently have other projects to cater.
